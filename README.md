## Intro

Until yet I have only been using Azure-Repos in my DevOps Projects, but since this is done different at a recent project I am participating, I felt the need for a playground with similar conditions.

Since I borrowed the django code to have something deployable, I don't want to conceal it's [origins](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/msdocs-python-django-webapp-quickstart). I did some modifications when I wanted to play around with python a bit, so don't get confused if you compare it with this version :sweat_smile:

## Deploy a Python (Django) web app to Azure App Service - Sample Application

This is the sample Django application for the Azure Quickstart [Deploy a Python (Django or Flask) web app to Azure App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-python).  For instructions on how to create the Azure resources and deploy the application to Azure, refer to the Quickstart article.

A Flask sample application is also available for the article at [https://github.com/Azure-Samples/msdocs-python-flask-webapp-quickstart](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/msdocs-python-flask-webapp-quickstart).

If you need an Azure account, you can [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).
