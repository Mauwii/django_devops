## Intro

:musical_note: These are not, the greatest docs in the World :notes: this is just a Playground :metal:

Welcome to the Docs of my DevOps / GitHub / Jira - Playground. I decided to host them on GitHub-Pages via [MkDocs-Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

## Tools/Frameworks

I used a combination of these tools and frameworks to have a useful playground I can experiment with:

- :fontawesome-brands-github: [__GitHub__](https://github.com/mauwii/django_devops) to host repositories
- :material-microsoft-azure-devops: [__Azure-DevOps__](https://dev.azure.com/mauwiidev/django_gh) to run the yaml pipelines
- :fontawesome-brands-atlassian: [__Jira__](https://mauwii.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/DG/issues) to manage issues
- :material-file-document: [__MkDocs-Material__](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) to host versionable documentation

## Expectations

You should try to keep your expectations low, then you will be amazed even more while finding out about the things I am just finding out myself with this playground.

``` mermaid
graph LR;
    You[You] -->|when found<br>this Page| expectation{Expectations};
    expectation{Expectations} -->|Low| Amazed(surely Amazed );
    expectation{Expectations} -->|High| Disappointed(maybe Disappointed);
```
