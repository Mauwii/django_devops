### Official Documentation

For a full list of most recent MkDocs-Material References have a look in the [official Documentation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/).

If you want to find out more about how to configure MkDocs-Material to use Diagrams you can do so [here](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/diagrams/?h=mermaid).

### Mermaid Live Editor

If you want to get started with Mermaid Diagrams, or already use them for your Project, I recommend to take a look at the [Mermaid live Editor](https://mermaid.live/), which is pretty helpflull for newbes as well as advanced users.
